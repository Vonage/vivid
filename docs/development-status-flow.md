# Inception
### How contributions are born and decided upon
Packages roadmap is feedback driven. meaning it is composed by requirements and relevance to Vonage LOBs.
We gather "field" information, process the complexity against mutual needs and set the course to delivery.
Requirements can be raised & discussed throughout the following channels and methods:
- [Repo discussions](https://github.com/Vonage/vivid/discussions)
- [Vivid on Jira](https://jira.vonage.com/secure/RapidBoard.jspa?rapidView=1220&projectKey=VIV&view=detail&selectedIssue=VIV-493)
- Slack channels: #ask-vivid / #vivid-engineering
- Bi-monthly sync talks
- [Airtable](https://airtable.com/shrwoX0oK31iAjq3N)
- [Design process](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13raGLpIC6bY7X3ugUNiX8HBnn9_u2Ded02WviDjz6bQ/edit?usp=sharing)

P.S. We're also bound to support UI Kit 1.0 (Volta) parity as primary objective

# First steps
Coordinate expectations and provide a POC as follow:

1. Draft document will be created as a [GitHub discussion](https://github.com/Vonage/vivid/discussions/732) and should contain proposed API and user stories
2. A notification / meeting will be set with relevant participants (Vivid team & LOB assigned ambassadors) to discuss and brainstorm the draft of specification
3. Document will be shared with attendees no less than 24 hours prior the meeting
4. From that point on a contribution is in development state and can be set to 1 of the WIP statuses

A period of 2 weeks (full sprint) should be enable all LOBs to take part in discussions on API / style / behavior or any other aspect of major **public** contribution
**Preview channel** should be available in the contribution **pull request** for all to review
