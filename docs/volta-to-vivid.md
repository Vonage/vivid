## Headers

Headers in Vivid got size upscale to provide more flexibility and options.
Therefore, any existing header level `X` in the Volta based application should be changed to header `X+2`:
| Volta | Vivid |
|-------|-------|
| `h1`  | `h3`  |
| `h2`  | `h4`  |
| `h3`  | `h5`  |
| `h4`  | `h6`  |
