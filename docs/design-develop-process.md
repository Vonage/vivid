Vivid project delivers components and services based on a unique Vonage Design System.
The development process includes incorporation of a designers artwork materials (palette, semantic colors, typography, shape definitions and many more) into the living code, which is being then built, tested and released as a ready-to-use packages.

Due to a well-known complexities in mediating between those two - artboards of designers and code of programmers, we decided to automate the whole process as much as possible, leaving the most critical points where human intervention required to be the only manual steps.
