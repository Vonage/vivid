### We are planning amazing things!

###### Our system contains the following aspects - general services, atomic components and high level business-logic specific components.

### Volta parity

As part of our 'go to market' plan, we are focusing first on the essential components, those that are already exist in Volta and are in use.
Quick transition of Volta's components towards Vivid's ones will allow us early-feedback/early-treatment, incremental development and prevent double development and future re-write of the new components.

### Milestones

We are entering 2021 while most of the basic, **atom** components are implemented and are in GA state.
We also already have quite a mature DevOps process including rich build, test and publish automation.

Product-wise, we are targeting to complete the missing functions in the **atom** and focus on a more complex rich components to come along the way - **composites**. In fact, we already have a handsome of those as well.

Moreover, many of the work-on-the-go processes are also automated, most notably pulling the data from the design tool (Figma) and incorporating it into the Vivid's living code.

While finalizing a few left-overs in the mentioned above, we are focusing in Q1 / Q2 of the 2021 on the documentation of the platform.

Side by side, we are constantly working with LOBs' teams to help them easily go through the initial ramp-up of the first-time integration.
