### Slack

The fastest way to reach out to the Vivid team or get updated on the lastest stuff is via [the Slack channel](https://vonage.slack.com/archives/GVC6M0QF2).

### Issues

Vivid uses Jira and GitHub Issues as the official bug trackers. While Jira is more for our own internal stuff management, GitHub Issues is probably the fastest channel to notify us on any issue. 

Please check the [existing issues](https://github.com/vonage/vivid/issues) first.
It's possible someone has already reported the same problem.

If your problem or idea is not addressed yet, [open a new one](https://github.com/vonage/vivid/issues/new).
