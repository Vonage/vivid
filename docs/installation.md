Our deliveries are available as GitHub packages, they are privately accessible within Vonage organization.

Please visit [Vivid packages page](https://github.com/Vonage/vivid/packages) to enlist our latest releases. You may further drill into each package to read its specific documentation, review previous versions etc.

GitHub packages may be consumed via various build systems, please refer to [this documentation](https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem) for more details.

Obviously, most likely Vivid products will be consumed as **npm** dependencies in **package.json**, specific documentation on that is located [here](https://help.github.com/en/packages/using-github-packages-with-your-projects-ecosystem/configuring-npm-for-use-with-github-packages#installing-a-package).
