# Vivid UI components

### Get up and running
* Clone the repo
* Do `yarn install` to bring all the dependencies
* Do `yarn start` to build the components and start a local dev server (you'll see the port in the console)
* Navigate to `https://localhost:5424/demos/index.html` (replace the port if needed) and start hacking with the components in the browser
* Welcome! :)
