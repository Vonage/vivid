### Get up and running
* Clone the repo
* Run `yarn` (repo relies on yarn workspaces) in order to build the repo once / bring the dependencies
* Run the following steps as the normal build-and-see flow:
	* `yarn build` - builds `css` from `scss`, compiles `ts` into `js`
	* `yarn dev:server` - runs dev server on `localhost` in order to see the demo pages
	* OR `yarn start` - is a shortcut for `build` and `dev:server`, for your convenience
	* AND `yarn watch` - observes & compiles scss / ts files in src folders. Run it in a separate terminal window in order to watch changes occur while editing files.
* Navigate to `https://localhost:5424/demos/index.html` (replace the port if needed) and start hacking with the components in the browser
* Welcome! :)
