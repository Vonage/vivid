# Vivid UI components ![develop build](https://github.com/Vonage/vivid/workflows/develop%20build/badge.svg?branch=develop)

[vivid.vonage.com for demos](https://vivid.vonage.com)

### Roadmap

Vivid project is set to deliver Vonage's own design system for the company project's front-ends.

The system contains these aspects:
- general services/facilities like fonts management, scheme management and alike
- atomic/generic components
- high level business specific components

> As part of our 'go to market' plan, we are focusing first on the essential components, those that are already exist in Volta and used. Quick transition of Volta's components towards Vivid's ones will allow us early-feedback/early-treatment, incremental development and prevent double development and future re-write of the new components.

### Get up and running
* Clone the repo
* Run `yarn` (repo relies on yarn workspaces) in order to build the repo once / bring the dependencies
* Run the following steps as the normal build-and-see flow:
	* `yarn build` - builds `css` from `scss`, compiles `ts` into `js`
	* `yarn dev:server` - runs dev server on `localhost` in order to see the demo pages
	* OR `yarn start` - is a shortcut for `build` and `dev:server`, for your convenience
	* AND `yarn watch` - observes & compiles scss / ts files in src folders. Run it in a separate terminal window in order to watch changes occur while editing files.
* Navigate to `https://localhost:5424/demos/index.html` (replace the port if needed) and start hacking with the components in the browser
* Welcome! :)
